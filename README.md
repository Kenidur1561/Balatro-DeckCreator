# Deck Creator Restoration Project

## Introduction

Deck Creator is a small tool for the game Balatro that allows users to create, save, load, and even share custom decks. And I plan to, with all of your help, make it work on the latest version!

If you want to contribute, look for the thread we're using in the discord and see what we're working on! Feel free to submit a pull request with any more fixes. Things will be wierd, but hopefully more functional than the default fork.

## Requirements

- Balatro 1.0.0c (or newer)
- Steamodded v0.9.8 (or newer)

## How to Install
- Head over to the releases page: [releases](https://github.com/adambennett/Balatro-DeckCreator/releases/latest)
- Download the .zip archive provided
- Extract the contents of the downloaded zip directly into your mods folder
- The result should be a directory at the path: ../Mods/Deck Creator/
- Under this 'Deck Creator' folder you should see a handful of Lua files, an 'assets' directory, and a 'Custom Decks' directory

## How to Use

- Load up modded Balatro (see [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded))
- Click on the "Mods" button on the main menu
- Click on "Deck Creator" by Nyoxide
- Click on "Create Deck"
- Choose all the options you would like. Options that are not changed will be defaulted to the normal default game options.
- Head back to the "General" tab when you're done, and click "Save Deck"
- The deck will be saved to a file called "CustomDecks.txt" under this mod's folder in another subdirectory. 
- If you would like to share your deck list with anyone, all they need to do is copy and paste your CustomDecks.txt file and place it into the folder in their Mods directory. This mod will detect all .txt files in there and merge all the deck lists together and load all decks into the game.
